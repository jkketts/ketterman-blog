My name is Justin Ketterman. I'm a software engineer, teacher and mentor.  

In 2019 I became a Consultant at Daugherty Business Solutions. I specialize in C# and the .NET ecosystem, mostly back end technologies in the healthcare and sciences fields. 

I collaborate with clients to build performant RESTful and GraphQL APIs, discover project requirements and specs to make sure we're creating as much value as possible, and developing teams' skills.
