## What's Version Control?

**Version control** is the idea of managing changes made to something, e.g. source code, over time. 

There are two different kinds of **version control systems** (VCS)- **centralized** and **distributed**. We'll be going through the basics of Git, which is a centralized VCS.

## Why do we need version control?
Imagine that you've spent some time creating an application and have gotten it to a point where it is usable.

Maybe it's a small bit of usability - something like a few functions or statements. The application's good enough for whatever feature you've implemented and it works. 

Later on, you come back and add a little bit more. Maybe someone else adds some code to your application. After some iterations of this, you realize that there was an issue in the last piece you created and have no idea what has caused the problem or where that issue came from. All you know is that the last time you were working with the code, it worked, and now you wish you could go back to that version.

It would be really nice to have something that allowed us to see what changes occured each time the application was saved, track who made those changes, and a way to revert back to those earlier versions. 

Version control does exactly that and a whole lot more.

## Where to begin

When I first started working with Git, I was not sure how **Git** was different than **GitHub**.
